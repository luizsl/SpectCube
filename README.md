# SpectCube

The SpectCube package aims to provide a fast and flexible tool for spectral resampling. This package performs the resampling conserving the integrated flux locally and globally. Performing resampling of individual spectrum, list of spectra or even cubes resulting from integral field spectroscopy (IFU). It is particularly interesting for processing large volumes of data. Thus, it becomes useful in preparing models and observations to be used in a wide variety of analyses.
