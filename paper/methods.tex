We developed the coded using \texttt{python 3} and it is available in a GitHub repository\footnote{\url{https://github.com/luizsl/SpectCube}}. The aim of the function is to get as input an array with fluxes and an array with the spectral axis and return to the user a new array of fluxes in a given spectral axis.

	f_j = \sum c_{ij}f_j
